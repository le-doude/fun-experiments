##What is this you say?

Sometimes I Just need to take the rust out of my Java. I have spent 1 yr in Scala and sometimes you just need to check.
This project has no meaning and is on github only because I need to transfer code between multiple computers.

##Can I use anything I like from the code in this repository?

Be my guest. Don't even give me credit. But all my other repositories have licenses or other conditions, respect those.
